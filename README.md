# WebAR Experiments

> This is a final project made by me as a student of Multiplatform Applications Development at Florida Universit√†ria. The purpose of this project is to **experiment with Augmented Reality on the web**.

## How to install: 
 
 Since we are using Webpack as a bundler, you have to install de dependencies to be able to run the project. Here you have the commands to install the dependencies, run on the server and build the project:
```
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```
